## üìÅ Project Structure

```bash
scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.sh                     # Creates Docker network and starts core services (DB, MailHog, phpMyAdmin)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create-site.sh              # Interactive script to scaffold a new WordPress project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ start-site.sh               # Safe startup script with port verification and service checks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stop-wp-site.sh             # Stops a running WordPress project from its folder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cleanup.sh                  # Stops and cleans up all WordPress containers and shared services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ remove-site.sh              # Fully deletes a WordPress project and unregisters its port
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ regenerate_reserved_ports.sh# Rebuilds reserved_ports.env from active containers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reserved_ports.env          # Auto-managed list of reserved ports
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template.reserved_ports.env # Static list of system/service ports to never assign
Makefile                        # Wrapper for all common commands
docker-compose.base.yml         # Shared services (MySQL, phpMyAdmin, MailHog)
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Shared Network & Base Services

Create the shared Docker network and boot up MySQL, MailHog, and phpMyAdmin:

```bash
make init
```

### 2. Create a New WordPress Site

Launch an interactive setup to create a new WordPress project folder:

```bash
make new-site
```

üõ† Includes:
- Prompts for site folder name, site name, DB name/user/password
- Suggests or auto-assigns a free port ‚â• 8000
- Checks for:
  - Port conflicts (running containers)
  - Reserved ports in `reserved_ports.env`
  - Critical ports from `template.reserved_ports.env`
- Generates:
  - `.env` file with full project configuration
  - `docker-compose.yml` based on templates
- Adds chosen port to `reserved_ports.env`

### 3. Start a WordPress Site Safely

Use the safe-start script to validate and launch a WordPress project:

```bash
make start-site
```

üß† What it does:
- Ensures the port from `.env` is not in use or reserved
- If needed, proposes a new port and updates `.env`
- Starts core services if not already up
- Starts the WordPress container via Docker Compose

‚úÖ You can run this command for run multiple sites in parallel (each site is separate by a comma e.g. site-1,site-2).

### 4. Stop a Specific WordPress Site

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
make stop-site
```

This stops only the targeted WordPress instance without touching others or core services.


‚úÖ You can run this command for stop multiple sites (each site is separate by a comma e.g. site-1,site-2 or all to stop all wordpress container currently running).

### 5. Remove a WordPress Project

Deletes an entire WordPress project safely:

```bash
make remove-site
```

üß® Includes:
- Prompts for confirmation
- Stops and removes containers
- Deletes folder contents
- Removes port from `reserved_ports.env`

### 6. Cleanup All WordPress Sites & Services

Stop **everything**, including core services and all site containers:

```bash
make cleanup
```

üßπ This:
- Stops all `wordpress-*` containers
- Stops MailHog, MySQL, phpMyAdmin
- Removes the shared Docker network

### 7. Regenerate the Reserved Port List

Rebuild the `reserved_ports.env` file based on currently running containers and the `template.reserved_ports` if its exist (otherwise it will create it and you should add the port that you want to lock there):

```bash
make regenerate-ports
```

---

## üõ† Makefile Commands

```make
init:                # Initialize shared network & core services
	@bash scripts/init.sh

new-site:            # Create new WordPress project interactively
	@bash scripts/create-site.sh

start-site:          # Start a WordPress project safely (port check)
	@bash scripts/start-site.sh

stop-site:           # Stop current WordPress project (from its folder)
	@bash scripts/stop-wp-site.sh

remove-site:         # Delete a WordPress project completely
	@bash scripts/remove-site.sh

cleanup:             # Stop and remove ALL WordPress containers + shared services
	@bash scripts/cleanup.sh

regenerate-ports:    # Rebuild reserved_ports.env dynamically
	@bash scripts/regenerate_reserved_ports.sh
```

---

## üí° Tip: Reserve Specific Ports

To avoid assigning specific ports when you create a new site you can edit:

```bash
scripts/template.reserved_ports.env
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è I recommend to not update immediately the reserved_ports.env instead you should update the template.reserved_ports.env and run `make regenerate-ports` in order to keep things clear.

***The RESERVED_PORTS variable present in the file reserved_ports.env will change everytime you add a project so you should keep away the port that your service are using in template.reserved_ports.env***

> Note: MailHog uses port 8025 by default and is automatically excluded from assignments.

---

## üìö Notes

- You can host **multiple isolated WordPress sites** in parallel ‚Äî each in its own folder.
- No port conflicts: each instance runs on a unique localhost port.
- phpMyAdmin runs at `http://localhost:8080`, MailHog at `http://localhost:8025`.
- All config is per-project and easy to back up or version.

---

## üîÑ Futur Improvements

- Add a command to add the possibility to add an hostname to the host file to use that instead of the ip address
- Add in the remove-site command the declaration in the host file
- More to come
